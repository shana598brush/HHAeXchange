# Contributing to HHAeXchange


Thank you for your interest in contributing to **HHAeXchange**! This document outlines how to contribute, report issues, suggest features, and the review process, as well as our code of conduct.


## Contribution Guidelines


We welcome contributions of all sizes: bug fixes, documentation improvements, ideas, tests, and features. Please follow these general rules:


- Follow the repository's coding conventions (readability, clear naming, small focused commits).
- Add or update tests where appropriate.
- Keep changes focused and split large changes into multiple PRs when possible.
- Update documentation (README or specific docs) when adding or changing features.


## How to Contribute


1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`.
3. Make changes on your branch and commit with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch in this repository.


Refer to the `README.md` for local setup and testing instructions.


## Reporting Issues


If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:


1. Check existing issues to see if it is already reported.
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and description.
3. Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, environment (OS, Node version), and any logs or screenshots.


## Suggesting Features


Feature requests are welcome. To suggest a feature:


- Open an issue and label it `enhancement`.
- Describe the problem, suggested solution, and how it benefits users.
- If possible, include a small mockup, sample API, or UX notes.


## Code of Conduct


We expect contributors to be respectful and collaborative. By participating, you agree to:


- Be kind and welcoming.
- Use respectful language and avoid personal attacks.
- Focus on the problem, not the person.


If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open a confidential issue to project maintainers.


## Review Process


- PRs will be reviewed by one or more maintainers.
- Reviewers may request changes, ask for tests, or suggest refactors.
- Please respond to review feedback and keep PRs up to date; maintainers may help with rebasing if needed.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.


Thanks for helping make HHAeXchange better!
